"""
Tests for the LangGraph orchestrator in AGENT_VF.orchestrator.graph.

**LLM-Code Suggestions Implemented:**
- Added integration tests for rewrite loop and error path handling.
- Structured fixtures for injecting mock/real components (placeholders added).
- Renamed tests for clarity.
- Used mocker fixture for patching within tests.
- Patched source library (langgraph) instead of local import path.
- Corrected redundant patching in unit test.
- Improved dummy graph return value for integration test robustness.
- Removed incorrect constructor call assertion in unit test.
